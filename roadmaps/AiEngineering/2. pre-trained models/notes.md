# Benefits of Pre-Trained Models
Pre-trained models offer several benefits in AI engineering by significantly reducing development time and computational resources because these models are trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, which enables quicker deployment and better performance with less data. They help overcome the challenge of needing vast amounts of labeled data and computational power for training from scratch. Additionally, pre-trained models often demonstrate improved accuracy, generalization, and robustness across different tasks, making them ideal for applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and other AI domains.

# Limitations and considerations

* Bias on training data
* Often trained on general data. Might not perform well on specific data
* Black-Box

# Open Ai Models

* Context Length -> the amount of input text the model can process at once. Measured in tokens.
* GPT 5 has 400.000 input tokens and 128.000 output. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models?utm_source=chatgpt.com&tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions

## Cut-off dates/knowledge
* OpenAI models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, have a knowledge cutoff date, which refers to the last point in time when the model was trained on data.
