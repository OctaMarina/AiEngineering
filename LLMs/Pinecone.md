# Pinecone

`Pinecone is like a super-smart, super-fast search engine — but instead of searching by words, it searches by meaning`


## Pinecone is:

* A managed vector database.
* Built to store and search embeddings (aka vectors).
* Used in RAG systems to find relevant documents based on similarity, not exact keywords.

# Why Use Pinecone?
Imagine you’ve turned 1,000 documents into vectors (with an embedding model). You now want to:
* Store them somewhere fast and scalable
* Search them to find the top 5 most relevant chunks
* Let your LLM generate an answer using those chunks
